Spaceman "Hangman" Game
Overview
The Spaceman "Hangman" game is a simple yet engaging web-based game inspired by the classic hangman format. Players try to guess a hidden word one letter at a time while launching a spaceship by making correct guesses. Incorrect guesses result in the spaceship getting closer to "crashing," and the game ends when the spaceship has no more fuel or the word is guessed correctly.
